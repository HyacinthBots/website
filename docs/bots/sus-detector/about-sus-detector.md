# Sus Detector

Sus Detector is a free & open-source Discord bot that aims to help combat the ever present issue of spambots in Discord.

The primary function of Sus Detector is for it to be set up to monitor a channel for messages sent and to then ban the 
account that sent the messages. The functionality is incredibly simple contains minimal extra logic. For this reason it
is recommended to set Sus Detector up to watch a public channel at the top of the list, or one of the oldest public 
channels in the server.

Sus Detector is ruthless, as it is intended to watch the first channel, it  bans the account very quickly. You should 
advise your users of the risks to avoid needless bans. Any user that has the `BanMembers` permission is able to get away
with sending messages in the channel.
